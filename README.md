`strain_control` is a package for controlling a Razorbill CSX1x0 strain cell with the Razorbill RP100 power supply (PS) and a Keysight E4980 LCR meter. The package is composed of two main submodules, the `strain_server`, which coordinates between the PS and LCR meter, and the `strain_client`, which allows for control of the `strain_server` from a Jupyter notebook or other scripting environment.
